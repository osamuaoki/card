%  Debian GNU/Linux developer business card template
%
%  This template is vaguely based on several similar ones I have
%  found elsewhere on the web; it uses a LaTeX ``picture'' environment
%  to position the text all around an individual card, and wraps that
%  in a bigger ``picture'' which renders 10 cards on the page in a
%  layout suitable for printing on Avery pre-punched business card
%  stock.
%
%  The modified cut marks are aligned outside the actual card. When cutting
%  this makes sure that there is no slight black line on the top or the
%  bottom of the cards. The best way to cut them is using a cutting wheel
%  [looks like a pizza cutter but is extrmely sharp] and a plastic pad. Use
%  a rular to guide the cutter. Cut the three vertical divisions first, but 
%  do not go past the top or bottom of the page. After that cut each card 
%  horizontally. If you have a sharp cutter you can cut more than one sheet
%  at once like this. The prefered type of paper is a heavy paper run through
%  a laser in the `straight through' path [usually in the manual feed and
%  out the face up tray on the back]

\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
%
%  I personally like the look of the CM fonts, especially compared to
%  plain old times/helvetica.  Of course, you can select a different
%  set of fonts here if you like -- Adobe Myriad looks good on a card,
%  and for mixed serif/sans the Stone family hangs together nicely,
%  but unfortunately those aren't part of TeX.
%
\usepackage{times}
%
\pagestyle{empty}
%
%  Before printing a final copy, you will probably have to tweak these
%  values to get the cards to properly line up with the cut marks.
%  Avery provides a sizing overlay with their cards; if you're having
%  these professionally printed, get the appropriate dimensions from
%  your printer [and you might need to adjust the multiput commands
%  below!].

%  The Debian logo.  I bet this would look good stamped in red
%  foil. :-) To make this one, I took the original .eps logo with
%  text, converted it to xfig format, removed the text, and converted
%  it back to .eps again.  You can put any other graphic you like
%  here, but of course it should be roughly the same proportion as the
%  area available on the card.
